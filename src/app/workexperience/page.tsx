    summary: "Contributed to the front-end development, testing, and security validation of a banking software solution using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Joget within an agile, low-code enterprise environment.",
    details: "As part of the development team for an enterprise-grade banking software solution, I was responsible for contributing to both the implementation and validation of front-end components using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Joget low-code platform. My role focused heavily on building secure, responsive, and intuitive user interfaces that aligned with financial compliance requirements and industry usability standards. Within Joget's environment, I collaborated on the design and customization of dynamic workflows tailored to complex banking processes, ensuring smooth user navigation and real-time feedback during critical actions such as form submissions and transaction tracking. I conducted extensive UI testing across a wide range of interactive forms and user-facing views, ensuring proper data flow, validation behavior, conditional logic, and consistent visual rendering across platforms. This included simulating real user interactions to verify that every form field, dropdown, button, and transition performed as expected under normal and edge-case conditions. I documented test results, flagged bugs, and proposed interface refinements to improve clarity, responsiveness, and accessibility, particularly in data-sensitive workflows such as account creation, approvals, and transaction reporting. Beyond UI development and testing, I actively participated in debugging issues across devices and browsers, identifying layout inconsistencies, fixing component rendering bugs, and enhancing input validation logic to prevent client-side errors. I also contributed to functional and security testing, working to simulate real-world usage scenarios‚Äîincluding edge cases‚Äîto expose hidden flaws or vulnerabilities before deployment. A key focus of my contribution was in strengthening application security. I supported the implementation and testing of safeguards against common web-based attack vectors, including PHP injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and form tampering. This involved writing and executing targeted test cases, reviewing code for exposure points, and assisting in the creation of logic paths that handle invalid or malicious input gracefully. I also contributed to refining the platform's escalation protocols in the event of anomalous behavior, supporting proactive monitoring and incident response readiness. Throughout the project, I worked within an agile development framework, attending sprint meetings, tracking task progress in collaborative tools, and regularly delivering updates on feature completion and testing outcomes. This experience gave me practical insight into secure software development lifecycles, compliance-sensitive design thinking, and the use of low-code platforms to rapidly prototype and deploy scalable solutions in the fintech domain.",

    summary: "Built a dynamic Power BI dashboard with Power Query, Excel, and VBA to track automotive program status, incorporating stakeholder feedback through weekly meetings.",
    details: "As part of the Corporate Program Management Office at Martinrea International, I was responsible for designing, developing, and deploying a scalable program tracking dashboard to support the end-to-end lifecycle of automotive vehicle programs‚Äîincluding RFQ, Design, Validation, Launch, and Production phases. My work involved architecting a robust data pipeline using Power Query to ingest, normalize, and clean multi-source program data. I then visualized this data using Power BI, creating a highly interactive dashboard with advanced filtering and segmentation capabilities to enable real-time tracking of program phases, deadlines, and escalation-priority items. To accommodate hybrid workflows and offline access, I also developed an Excel-based replica of the dashboard using PivotTables and custom VBA automation scripts, allowing non-technical stakeholders to generate live reports and perform secure, rule-driven calculations within their existing tools. This solution helped surface critical red items‚Äîflagged for executive escalation‚Äîwhile improving visibility into high-priority deadlines and dependencies across dozens of concurrent vehicle programs. In addition to technical development, I worked closely with program managers and stakeholders, actively participating in weekly progress meetings to gather feedback, refine feature sets, and align the dashboard with operational goals. I incorporated iterative recommendations to improve usability, speed, and decision-making clarity‚Äîensuring the tool met the fast-paced, compliance-heavy demands of automotive program execution. This experience deepened my expertise in data-driven application design, business intelligence tooling, stakeholder collaboration, and agile iteration within a high-stakes enterprise environment.",
